## Project Details

Celestial Manufacturer is a manufacturer company. They were looking for a front-end web developer to build a website for them.
So I made a mockup site from their given requirement. It includes some challanging issue on Stripe. Other than this the website is not that complicated. But real case sceniario will have more feature and will need more secured connection. In JWT token a simple 2bit hexa code was used. But in real scenario they will use more advance encryption like `RSA Encryption`.

### Color Combination
For Warmth look the primary and secondary color was choosed in Blue sky gradient.
Primary Color: `#1d2671`
Secondary Color: `#c4e0e5`
